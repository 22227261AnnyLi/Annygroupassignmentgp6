            <h1 align=“center”>Reason that fake news and rumors emerge</h1>
             <h2>1. Emergence of fake news/rumors:</h2>
                 <h3>1.1 Propagating their own position: </h3>

However, someone who getting irrational will do everything they can to achieve their purpose, like making fake news/rumors.</p>
                 <h3>1.2 Business purpose:</h3>
                     <p> To attract all the potential players, some game studio/manufacturers will make the advertisement that deceive audiences. No matter how many players they attracted, they can gain profit by pushing other advertisements in their game. If they are lucky enough and get some players that invest a lot of money, they can gain an appreciable profit because of the low cost of making those games.</p>
            <h2>2. Spread of fake news/rumors:</h2>

The unconscious process affected by long-term custom, which is difficult to change and spends more energy for considering. The controlled process affected by education and persuade, which can be change easier and spends less energy for considering. Because of the inertness of human brain, most message we received will handle by the unconscious process. Therefore, fake news/rumors can be always trusted easily and be spread rapid.</p>
                 <h3>2.2 Misleading title and content:</h3>
                     <p>Fake news/Rumors are always being exaggerated, subjected and incomplete. Because the initiator want the message they sent being more eye-catching and well-known. Combining with the effect of unconscious process, fake news/rumors spread rapid.</p>
